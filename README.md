# joelnet from scratch
This is a learning project to reproduce joelnet, Joel Grus's Deep Learning library.\
I've never met or talked to Joel in person, however I find his content high-quality and very educational:
* books: Data Science from Scratch, Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz
* videos: Live Coding Madness, Advent of Code, Jupyter Notebooks...etc.

Regarding this project, full credit and original repository: https://github.com/joelgrus/joelnet

# Livecoding Madness: Let's Build a Deep Learning Library

In this talk we'll build a deep learning library
from scratch (well, from NumPy) in 45 minutes.

How is that possible? By typing _really_ fast.

Along the way we'll talk about library design,
type hinting, Python 3.6, and of course deep learning.


# Here's the plan:

1. Tensors
2. Loss Functions
3. Layers
4. Neural Nets
5. Optimizers
6. Data
7. Training
8. XOR Example
9. FizzBuzz Example
